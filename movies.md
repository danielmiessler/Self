Movies
======

I've always been a very casual moviegoer. I've never been much into it. But now, as I'm turning 40 I feel like I'm starting to enjoy film much more. Or perhaps art in general.

My latest idea has been to parse the last 10 years of the top contender films in the main film festivals, and watch those movies. Some great movies hit the mainstream, but most do not. So I will go where I know I can find them. Once I do that collection project I'll add them to the "to see" category below.
