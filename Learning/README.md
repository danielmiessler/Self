Learning
========

This is a project where I will capture knowledge from the content I consume, whether that's in the form of books, lectures, presentations, or whatever.

## Problem and Purpose

The goal is to master the problem of long-term benefit from knowledge, i.e. it really sucks to spend time consuming information only to not be able to recall what you got from it months or years later.

## Approach

Entries will come in the form of single files per source, in Markdown format. Major concept captures will be single hashes, subconcepts will be double hashes, etc.

The naming convention will be book_lord_of_the_flies.md, and preso_some_ted_talk.md, etc.

## Best of Luck

Hopefully this will inspire us to capture what we learn in an organized, sustained way.
