This file will track my beliefs over time.

## Reality

- Human existence is subordinate to the laws of physics, and thus we cannot have free will as defined as "the ability to have done otherwise"
- Because we have no free will, true moral responsibility does not exist
- We, being human, cannot build societies based on the fact that free will (and thus personal responsibility) does not truly exist, and thus we must must knowingly embrace the illusion of free will in order to enjoy our lives to the fullest and construct a civilization worth living in
- While this is contradictory it is essential, as we can neither 1) pretend we actually have free will (because believing untruths is dangerous over time), nor 2) live our daily lives as if we are mere configurations of matter and energy

## Morality

- On top of this reality framework, we can construct a moral framework
- This framework is based on the work of Bertrand Russell and Sam Harris, and states that our goal as humans and as a civilization should be to reduce suffering and increase happiness for conscious creatures by leveraging reason and compassion
- This should be pursued through the embrace of science to harvest data on what changes should be implemented in the world to best bring about the reduction of suffering and an increase in happiness
- This moral framework allows one to evaluate common moral or political questions with a quasi-objective system, which yields consistent results that are likely to be embraced by the most possible people (given a requisite amount of education and respect for science)
