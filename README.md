Self
====

This repository will serve as a tracking system for everything about myself that I want to keep current, such as my beliefs, my passions, my must-haves, my must-dos, my favorite movies, books, quotes, aphorisms, etc.

Basically, if it's a list of any sort, related to me in the long term,
I'm going to track it here. Doing so through git offers a couple
of interesting advantages:

1. You get to track your changes over time through git history
2. It's an ideal way to both share and fork your lists

I hope the concept is exciting to you as it is to me, and feel free to
reach out to me at http://danielmiessler.com/connect if you'd like to
chat about it.

Best,

Daniel
